# Portuguese Character Encoding Fix - Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

1. **Deploy to Render**: Push this commit to trigger deployment
2. **Wait for deployment**: The automatic fix will run during database initialization
3. **Check the logs**: Look for these messages in Render logs:
   - `🔍 Checking database for Portuguese character corruption...`
   - `🔧 Found X corrupted records, running fix...`
   - `✅ Automatic encoding fix completed`

## 🔧 Manual Testing & Fixing

If automatic fix doesn't work, you can manually trigger it:

### Option 1: Admin Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to your app: `https://your-frontend.onrender.com`
2. Login as admin
3. Navigate to "Configurações" page
4. Click "Verificar Dados" to check for corruption
5. Click "Corrigir Codificação" to fix if corruption found

### Option 2: Direct API Calls
```bash
# Check for corruption
curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/test/check-corruption

# Test encoding endpoint
curl https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/test/test

# Fix encoding (POST request)
curl -X POST https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/test/fix-encoding
```

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Before Fix:
- Names like: `Gon??alves`, `Ant??nio`, `Jos??`
- Words like: `Configura????es`, `Informa????o`, `Fun????o`
- Other corrupted patterns: `Ã§`, `â€™`, `????`

### After Fix:
- Names like: `Gonçalves`, `António`, `José`
- Words like: `Configurações`, `Informação`, `Função`
- Proper Portuguese characters displayed correctly

## 📊 Character Mapping Coverage

This fix handles these corruption patterns:

1. **Double Question Marks**: `??` → `ç`, `????` → `ção`
2. **UTF-8 Double Encoding**: `Ã§` → `ç`, `Ã£` → `ã`
3. **Smart Quote Corruption**: `â€™` → `'`, `â€œ` → `"`
4. **Common Name Patterns**: `Gon??alves` → `Gonçalves`
5. **Word Ending Patterns**: `????o` → `ção`, `????es` → `ções`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If characters still appear corrupted:

1. **Check the logs** in Render for error messages
2. **Use the admin interface** to manually check and fix
3. **Call the API directly** to see detailed error responses
4. **Check specific examples** using the corruption report feature

### Common issues:

- **Database not being restored**: Check if tables exist
- **Permission issues**: Ensure production environment variables are set
- **New corruption patterns**: Use the corruption check to identify new patterns
